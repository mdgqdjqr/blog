Dear Kate,

​		I wonder if you can lend me your MLA Handbook for Academic Writing. I am in the process of writing my graduation thesis, and need to consult the book now and then for standard formatting. Thus I might need to keep the book for about a month and a half, and I hope that will not bring any inconvenience to you. I assure you that I will maintain the book in good condition.

​		If possible, please give me a call and I will come by your house to pick up the book. Thanks a lot.

<p align="right">Yours,</p>

Dear Mr. president,

I am a student in our university who regularly comes to the library to spend my spare time. Generally speaking, the services your offer are quite good. However, I have some insufficient suggestions for you.

Firstly, it will be greatly appreciated if you could prolong the time for reading. Because in the daytime, most of the students are having classes, and they cannot come to the library.

I would also recommend the library to improve the efficiency of purchasing new books and subscribing to academic journals. Last but not least, the study rooms need to be furnished with a better lighting system.
